# Henrik's notebooks

A collection of my Jupyter notebooks from past presentations and talks. They cover the former IBM Bluemix, now IBM Cloud as well as IBM Db2, the relational (SQL) database system. Other notebooks show simple data analysis and visualization techniques, including heatmap with time axis. For details see the individual notebooks.
